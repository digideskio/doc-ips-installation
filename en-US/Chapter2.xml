	<title>Installation of the Enterprise Version redborder Manager</title>
	<para>Thanks to the installation wizard, the Manager can be configured and prepared quickly and easily without the need for specific Linux programming knowledge.</para> 
	<para>For the Manager installation, the user will have an <emphasis role="bold">ISO image</emphasis> obtained via download or through <emphasis role="bold">DVD</emphasis> facilitated by redborder. 
	If the image was obtained via download, you can download it to your local disk or save it to a DVD or USB to be installed on a physical machine. In any case, once the first phase of installation is done, 
	the system will restart and will boot up from the default option: <literal>Select from local disk.</literal></para>
	<para>Upon booting up, the installation wizard will have access to a menu with the following options:</para>
	<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
